# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SecPal projects! This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to SecPal.

## Purpose

This Agreement enables SecPal to maintain a **dual-licensing model**:

- **Open Source License**: All contributions are licensed under the [AGPL-3.0-or-later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) license
- **Commercial License**: SecPal may offer commercial licenses to third parties for use cases incompatible with AGPL

By signing this CLA, you retain full copyright ownership of your contributions while granting SecPal the necessary rights to distribute your work under both licensing models.

## Which Agreement Should I Use?

### Individual Contributor

If you are contributing as an **individual** (not on behalf of your employer), use the [Individual CLA](#individual-contributor-license-agreement).

### Corporate Contributor

If you are contributing as part of your employment or your employer has intellectual property rights in your contributions, your employer must sign the [Corporate CLA](#corporate-contributor-license-agreement).
