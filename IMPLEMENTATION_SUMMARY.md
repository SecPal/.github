**File:** `.github/pull_request_template.md`

**Features:**

- ⚠️ Prominent reminder to use draft PRs
- 📋 Standard checklist for PR authors
- 📊 Status flow visualization
- 🔗 Automatic linking to project automation

**Benefits:**

- Sets expectations for draft PR workflow
- Standardizes PR descriptions
- Reduces cognitive load on contributors

### 2. Draft PR Reminder Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/draft-pr-reminder.yml`

**Triggers:** When non-draft PR is opened

**Action:** Posts friendly comment suggesting draft PR benefits

**Benefits:**

- Gentle nudge without being intrusive
- Educational for contributors
- Doesn't block workflow

### 3. Updated Project Automation Logic

**File:** `.github/workflows/project-automation-v2.yml`

**Changed Logic:**

| Event                 | Old Behavior   | New Behavior              |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| PR opened (draft)     | Ignored        | → 🚧 In Progress          |
| PR opened (non-draft) | → 👀 In Review | → 👀 In Review + reminder |
| PR ready for review   | → 👀 In Review | → 👀 In Review            |

**Benefits:**

- Draft PRs trigger status updates (In Progress)
- Aligns with actual development workflow
- Saves CI resources when used correctly

### 4. Updated Documentation

**File:** `WORKFLOW_REVIEW.md`

**Updates:**

- New test scenarios (7-12) for PR workflows
- Updated event coverage table
- Expanded success criteria
- Added edge cases for abandoned PRs

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Issue Lifecycle (Scenarios 1-6)

- ✅ Enhancement → Ideas
- ✅ Core feature → Planned
- ✅ Blocker → Backlog
- ✅ Close completed → Done
- ✅ Close not planned → Won't Do
- ✅ Reopen → Discussion

### PR Lifecycle (Scenarios 7-12)

- ✅ Draft PR → In Progress
- ✅ Ready for review → In Review
- ✅ Non-draft PR → In Review (+ reminder)
- ✅ Changes requested → In Progress
- ✅ Merge → Done
- ✅ Close without merge → No change

## 📋 Review Checklist

**Before Commit:**

- [x] PR template created with SPDX headers
- [x] Draft reminder workflow created
- [x] Project automation logic updated
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Test scenarios comprehensive
- [ ] All files pass linting (minor warnings acceptable)
- [ ] Reviewed for security issues
- [ ] Reviewed for edge cases

**After Commit (Testing Phase):**

- [ ] Run all 12 test scenarios
- [ ] Verify draft PR reminder works
- [ ] Verify PR template appears
- [ ] Check workflow logs
- [ ] Validate status transitions
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Verify no regressions

## 🚀 Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment (.github repo)

1. Commit all files to feature branch
2. Create PR for review
3. Merge to main
4. Run manual tests (scenarios 1-12)
5. Monitor for 24-48 hours

### Phase 2: Iteration

1. Fix any issues found during testing
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Refine logic based on real usage

### Phase 3: Rollout to Other Repos

1. Update api, frontend, contracts repos
2. Copy PR template to each repo
3. Add workflow call to project-automation-v2
4. Test in each repo with real issue

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Draft PRs?

1. **Cost savings** - CI runs are expensive
2. **Copilot credits** - Reviews consume API quota
3. **Accurate status** - Reflects actual work state
4. **Developer experience** - Clear workflow

### Why Reminder Instead of Enforcement?

1. **Flexibility** - Sometimes non-draft makes sense (hotfixes)
2. **Education** - Teaching better than forcing
3. **Non-blocking** - Doesn't prevent work
4. **Culture** - Builds good habits over time

### Why Update on Draft PR?

1. **Visibility** - Team knows work is happening
2. **Tracking** - Project board reflects reality
3. **Workflow** - Matches developer mental model
4. **Consistency** - All PRs trigger updates

## ⚠️ Potential Issues & Mitigations

### Issue: Developers ignore template

**Mitigation:** Reminder workflow educates over time

### Issue: Too many status changes

**Mitigation:** Idempotent updates, only change when needed

### Issue: Race conditions with multiple PRs

**Mitigation:** Last write wins, acceptable for now

### Issue: Linked issue detection fails

**Mitigation:** Graceful degradation, logs error, continues

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Immediate (Technical):**

- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] Zero workflow errors
- [ ] Status updates < 30s latency

**Short-term (1-2 weeks):**

- [ ] 80%+ PRs opened as drafts
- [ ] No complaints about automation
- [ ] Reduced CI costs (measurable)

**Long-term (1+ month):**

- [ ] Workflow becomes invisible (just works)
- [ ] Project board stays accurate
- [ ] Team adopts draft PR habit

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Review this summary** ✅
2. **Final code review** - Check for issues
3. **Commit & push** - To feature branch
4. **Create PR** - For main branch
5. **Manual testing** - Run all 12 scenarios
6. **Monitor & iterate** - Fix issues as found
7. **Document learnings** - Update wiki/docs
8. **Rollout** - To other repos when stable
