## üì± Mobile Apps

### Idea: Native Mobile Apps for Guards

**Context:**
Guards in the field need quick access to the guard book while on patrol, often in areas with poor network connectivity.

**Concept:**

- Native iOS/Android apps (React Native or Flutter)
- Offline-first architecture with sync
- Biometric authentication (fingerprint, Face ID)
- Camera integration for incident photos
- GPS tracking for patrol routes
- NFC/QR code scanning for checkpoints

**When to revisit:**

- After web frontend reaches v1.0
- When field testing shows demand
- When budget allows native development

**Complexity:** High
**Priority:** Future (post-1.0)

**Related Issues:** _None yet_

## üîê Advanced Security Features

### Idea: Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration

**Context:**
For maximum legal compliance, cryptographic operations (signatures, checksums) could use certified hardware.

**Concept:**

- Integration with HSM or cloud HSM (AWS CloudHSM, Azure Key Vault)
- Store signing keys in tamper-proof hardware
- Meet eIDAS Advanced Electronic Signature requirements
- Support for smartcard-based signatures

**When to revisit:**

- When targeting government/military contracts
- When eIDAS compliance becomes mandatory
- When commercial licensing generates revenue for hardware investment

**Complexity:** Very High
**Cost:** ‚Ç¨5,000-50,000+ (hardware) + integration effort

**Related:**

- ADR-001 mentions digital signatures
- Future ADR needed for signature strategy

---

### Decision Made: OpenTimestamp (Blockchain-Based)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **DECIDED** - See ADR-002

**Context:**
German law requires provable timestamps for guard book records (BewachV ¬ß10).

**Decision:**
Use **OpenTimestamp** instead of traditional RFC 3161 TSA for cost-effective, decentralized timestamping.

**Rationale:**

- ‚úÖ Zero recurring costs (vs. ‚Ç¨0.01-0.10/timestamp with TSA)
- ‚úÖ Bitcoin blockchain as trust anchor (long-term verifiable)
- ‚úÖ No vendor lock-in
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not eIDAS "qualified timestamp" (but sufficient for BewachV ¬ß10)

**Next Steps:**

- Legal review confirms acceptability (Issue #46)
- Implement in Phase 3 of Event Sourcing (ADR-001)

**Alternative (Hybrid Approach):**
If legal review requires eIDAS compliance, we could use:

- OpenTimestamp for bulk events (cost-effective)
- RFC 3161 qualified timestamps for critical events only (shift handovers, legal disputes)

**Related:**

- ADR-002: OpenTimestamp for Audit Trail
- legal-compliance.md: BewachV requirements

## üåç Multi-Tenancy & SaaS

### Idea: Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

**Context:**
Currently architecting for single organization. Future possibility: SaaS for multiple security companies.

**Architectural Questions:**

1. **Database per tenant** vs. **shared database with tenant_id**?
2. Event store isolation per tenant?
3. Backup/restore per tenant?
4. Custom branding per tenant?
5. Tenant-specific feature flags?

**When to revisit:**

- After first production deployment succeeds
- When approached by other security companies
- When considering VC funding / business model pivot

**Complexity:** Very High (architectural refactoring)

**Decisions needed:**

- Pricing model (per user, per shift, per entry?)
- Free tier vs. paid-only?
- Self-hosted option vs. cloud-only?

**Related:**

- ADR-001 mentions "Multi-tenancy: Separate event stores per organization?"

- Alert supervisors to potential issues
- Risk scoring for locations/times

**When to revisit:**

- After 6-12 months of production data
- When data volume justifies ML investment
- If client demand exists

**Complexity:** High
**Skills needed:** Data science, ML engineering

---

### Idea: Natural Language Processing for Incident Reports

**Context:**
Guards write incident descriptions in free text. NLP could extract structured data.

**Concept:**

- Use NLP to extract: Involved persons, time, location, incident type
- Auto-suggest tags/categories
- Sentiment analysis (escalation risk?)
- Multi-language support (German + English + ...)

**When to revisit:**

- After frontend includes rich text editor
- When incident volume justifies automation
- When affordable NLP APIs exist (GPT-4, Anthropic Claude)

**Cost:** API calls (‚Ç¨0.01-0.10 per incident?)

---

## üìä Analytics & Reporting

### Idea: Advanced Analytics Dashboard

**Context:**
Security managers need insights beyond raw guard book entries.

**Features:**

- Client-specific reports
- Predictive analytics (forecast high-risk periods)
- Cost per shift calculations
- KPI tracking (response times, patrol compliance)

**When to revisit:**

- After core guard book functionality is stable
- When user research shows demand
- When data volume allows meaningful analytics

**Complexity:** Medium-High

**Tech considerations:**

- Use dedicated analytics database? (ClickHouse, TimescaleDB)
- Data warehouse pattern?
- BI tool integration (Metabase, Superset)?

---

## üîó Integrations

### Idea: Integration with Access Control Systems

**Context:**
Many security services manage building access (key cards, biometric readers).

**Concept:**

- Integrate with access control APIs (SALTO, ASSA ABLOY, etc.)
- Log access events in guard book
- Cross-reference incidents with access logs
- Alert on unusual access patterns

**When to revisit:**

- When clients request this feature
- After core platform is stable

**Complexity:** Medium (depends on API availability)

---

### Idea: Emergency Services Integration

**Context:**
For serious incidents, guards need to contact police/fire/ambulance.

**Concept:**

## üî¨ Research Topics

### Topic: GDPR "Right to Erasure" vs. Immutable Events

**Problem:**
Event sourcing is immutable, but GDPR requires ability to delete personal data.

**Solutions to research:**

1. **Crypto-shredding:** Encrypt events with user-specific key, delete key = data unreadable
2. **Tombstone events:** `user.personal_data.redacted` event replaces personal info
3. **Pseudonymization:** Store personal data separately, link via UUID, delete personal data but keep events
4. **Legal exception:** Is guard book exempt due to legal retention requirements?

**When to research:**

- Before v1.0 launch
- During legal review
- When GDPR audit happens

**Related:**

- Issue #46 (Legal Review)
- Future ADR needed

---

### Topic: Long-Term Archival (10+ Years)

**Problem:**
Events must be readable decades later. File formats, databases, encryption change.

**Solutions to research:**

1. **WORM storage** (Write-Once-Read-Many) - AWS Glacier, tape libraries
2. **PDF/A format** for exports (ISO 19005, archival standard)
3. **Migration strategy:** Periodic re-export to newer formats
4. **Blockchain anchoring:** Store merkle root in public blockchain

**When to research:**

- Before first long-term contracts
- During legal review
- When planning storage budget

---

### Topic: Offline-First Architecture

**Problem:**
Guards may have no internet in basements, remote areas.

**Solutions to research:**

1. **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** for offline sync
2. **PouchDB/CouchDB** for offline storage + sync
3. **Service Workers** for web app offline capability
4. **Operational Transformation** for concurrent editing

**When to research:**

- Before mobile app development
- When field testing shows connectivity issues
