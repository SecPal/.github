## üì± Mobile Apps

### Idea: Native Mobile Apps for Guards

**Context:**
Guards in the field need quick access to the guard book while on patrol, often in areas with poor network connectivity.

**Concept:**

- Native iOS/Android apps (React Native or Flutter)
- Offline-first architecture with sync
- Biometric authentication (fingerprint, Face ID)
- Camera integration for incident photos
- GPS tracking for patrol routes
- NFC/QR code scanning for checkpoints

**When to revisit:**

- After web frontend reaches v1.0
- When field testing shows demand
- When budget allows native development

**Complexity:** High
**Priority:** Future (post-1.0)

**Related Issues:** _None yet_

---

## üîê Advanced Security Features

### Idea: Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration

**Context:**
For maximum legal compliance, cryptographic operations (signatures, checksums) could use certified hardware.

**Concept:**

- Integration with HSM or cloud HSM (AWS CloudHSM, Azure Key Vault)
- Store signing keys in tamper-proof hardware
- Meet eIDAS Advanced Electronic Signature requirements
- Support for smartcard-based signatures

**When to revisit:**

- When targeting government/military contracts
- When eIDAS compliance becomes mandatory
- When commercial licensing generates revenue for hardware investment

**Complexity:** Very High
**Cost:** ‚Ç¨5,000-50,000+ (hardware) + integration effort

**Related:**

- ADR-001 mentions digital signatures
- Future ADR needed for signature strategy

---

### Decision Made: OpenTimestamp (Blockchain-Based)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **DECIDED** - See ADR-002

**Context:**
German law requires provable timestamps for guard book records (BewachV ¬ß10).

**Decision:**
Use **OpenTimestamp** instead of traditional RFC 3161 TSA for cost-effective, decentralized timestamping.

**Rationale:**

- ‚úÖ Zero recurring costs (vs. ‚Ç¨0.01-0.10/timestamp with TSA)
- ‚úÖ Bitcoin blockchain as trust anchor (long-term verifiable)
- ‚úÖ No vendor lock-in
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not eIDAS "qualified timestamp" (but sufficient for BewachV ¬ß10)

**Next Steps:**

- Legal review confirms acceptability (Issue #46)
- Implement in Phase 3 of Event Sourcing (ADR-001)

**Alternative (Hybrid Approach):**
If legal review requires eIDAS compliance, we could use:

- OpenTimestamp for bulk events (cost-effective)
- RFC 3161 qualified timestamps for critical events only (shift handovers, legal disputes)

**Related:**

- ADR-002: OpenTimestamp for Audit Trail
- legal-compliance.md: BewachV requirements

3. Backup/restore per tenant?
4. Custom branding per tenant?
5. Tenant-specific feature flags?

**When to revisit:**

- After first production deployment succeeds
- When approached by other security companies
- When considering VC funding / business model pivot

**Complexity:** Very High (architectural refactoring)

**Decisions needed:**

- Pricing model (per user, per shift, per entry?)
- Free tier vs. paid-only?
- Self-hosted option vs. cloud-only?

**Related:**

- ADR-001 mentions "Multi-tenancy: Separate event stores per organization?"

## üî¨ Research Topics

### Topic: GDPR "Right to Erasure" vs. Immutable Events

**Problem:**
Event sourcing is immutable, but GDPR requires ability to delete personal data.

**Solutions to research:**

1. **Crypto-shredding:** Encrypt events with user-specific key, delete key = data unreadable
2. **Tombstone events:** `user.personal_data.redacted` event replaces personal info
3. **Pseudonymization:** Store personal data separately, link via UUID, delete personal data but keep events
4. **Legal exception:** Is guard book exempt due to legal retention requirements?

**When to research:**

- Before v1.0 launch
- During legal review
- When GDPR audit happens

**Related:**

- Issue #46 (Legal Review)
- Future ADR needed

---

### Topic: Long-Term Archival (10+ Years)

**Problem:**
Events must be readable decades later. File formats, databases, encryption change.

**Solutions to research:**

1. **WORM storage** (Write-Once-Read-Many) - AWS Glacier, tape libraries
2. **PDF/A format** for exports (ISO 19005, archival standard)
3. **Migration strategy:** Periodic re-export to newer formats
4. **Blockchain anchoring:** Store merkle root in public blockchain

**When to research:**

- Before first long-term contracts
- During legal review
- When planning storage budget

---

### Topic: Offline-First Architecture

**Problem:**
Guards may have no internet in basements, remote areas.

**Solutions to research:**

1. **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** for offline sync
2. **PouchDB/CouchDB** for offline storage + sync
3. **Service Workers** for web app offline capability
4. **Operational Transformation** for concurrent editing

**When to research:**

- Before mobile app development
- When field testing shows connectivity issues

---

## üÜî BWR Integration (Security Service Register)

### Idea: BWR Registry Integration in Employee Records

**Context:**
According to ¬ß11b BewachV (German Security Services Act), security companies must ensure their employees are registered in the Bewachungsregister (BWR - Security Service Register). Manual verification is error-prone and time-consuming.

**Concept:**

- **BWR-ID in Employee Record:**
  - Required field for employees with guard responsibilities
  - Automatic format validation
  - Link to IHK portal (if API available)
- **BWR Status Tracking:**
  - Status: `active`, `suspended`, `expired`, `not_registered`
  - Registration expiry date
  - Automatic notifications before expiry (30/60/90 days advance)
  - Block shift planning if status invalid
- **Activity Areas (¬ß34a GewO Paragraphs):**
  - Paragraph 1: Patrol duties (all guards)
  - Paragraph 2: Protection against shoplifting
  - Paragraph 3: Security at entry areas (bouncers)
  - Paragraph 4: Security at refugee accommodations
  - Paragraph 5: City patrol
  - Mapping to SecPal qualifications
- **Compliance Dashboard:**
  - Overview: How many employees have valid BWR entries?
  - Warnings for expiring registrations
  - Reports for authorities/clients
- **Optional: API Integration (if available):**
  - Automatic synchronization with IHK database
  - Real-time status updates
  - Eliminate manual data entry

**When to revisit:**

- After Employee Management v1.0
- When official BWR-API becomes available
- Coordinate with IHK/authorities

**Complexity:** Medium (Data Model) to High (with API)
**Priority:** Soon (important for compliance!)

**Related:**

- Employee Management (Core Feature)
- Qualifications System (Core Feature)
- Legal Compliance (docs/legal-compliance.md)
- Issue #... (to be created for detailed specification)

**Technical Notes:**

- BWR-ID Format: Check if standardized format exists
- Data Privacy: Clarify if BWR status is personal data (GDPR)
- API: Check IHK-API availability (may be manual only)

## üìÖ Advanced Shift Planning Features

### Idea: (Semi-)Automated Shift Planning with Employee Suggestions

**Context:**
Manual shift planning is time-consuming. Managers need support to find available employees who meet all requirements (qualifications, working time law, preferences). Current `feature-requirements.md` includes basic auto-scheduling, but advanced AI-driven suggestions are not yet specified.

**Concept:**

**1. Intelligent Employee Suggestions:**

- **Context-Aware Recommendations:**
  - Manager starts planning a shift (e.g., "Night shift, Object A, 22:00-06:00")
  - System analyzes requirements: Qualifications (¬ß34a, First Aid), location, time
  - System suggests **ranked list** of suitable employees:

```
üü¢ Max Mustermann (Optimal Match)
   ‚úÖ ¬ß34a certification valid
   ‚úÖ First Aid certification valid
   ‚úÖ Available (no vacation, no conflicting shift)
   ‚úÖ Preferred shift time (marked "Night shifts OK")
   ‚úÖ Recently worked at Object A (familiar with location)
   üí∞ Regular rate (no overtime premium)

üü° Anna Schmidt (Good Match)
   ‚úÖ ¬ß34a certification valid
   ‚úÖ First Aid certification valid
   ‚úÖ Available (no conflicts)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Prefers day shifts (but not blocked)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è New to Object A (requires briefing)
   üí∞ Regular rate

üî¥ Tom M√ºller (Possible, but issues)
   ‚úÖ ¬ß34a certification valid
   ‚ùå First Aid expired (needs renewal)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Would exceed 48h/week (requires approval)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Last shift ended 10h ago (min 11h rest period)
```

**2. AI-Powered Optimization:**

- **Machine Learning Suggestions:**
  - Learn from historical data: "Max and Anna work well together"
  - Predict employee availability based on patterns
  - Optimize for cost (minimize overtime, travel expenses)
  - Fairness algorithm: Distribute unpopular shifts equitably
- **Multi-Week Planning:**
  - Plan entire month in one go
  - System generates multiple scenarios
  - Manager reviews and adjusts
- **Conflict Resolution:**
  - Highlight conflicts before they occur
  - Suggest alternative assignments
  - Explain why certain assignments are not possible

**3. Rule-Based Constraints:**

- **Hard Constraints (must be met):**
  - Working Time Law (ArbZG): Max 10h/day, 48h/week average
  - Rest periods: Min 11h between shifts
  - Qualifications: Must have required certificates
  - Availability: Not on vacation, not sick
- **Soft Constraints (preferred but not mandatory):**
  - Employee preferences (preferred times, locations)
  - Familiarity with location (worked there before)
  - Team composition (prefer known team members)
  - Cost optimization (avoid overtime if possible)

**4. "What-If" Scenarios:**

- Manager can test different configurations
- "What if Anna takes vacation on 05.11?"
- System recalculates and shows impact
- Helps with contingency planning

**When to revisit:**

- After basic shift planning (feature-requirements.md) is implemented
- When historical data is available for ML training
- When managers report bottlenecks in manual planning

**Complexity:** Very High (AI/ML, Optimization Algorithms)
**Priority:** Later (Phase 3-4, after MVP)

**Technical Notes:**

- Could use constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solvers
- ML models require 6-12 months of historical data
- Consider external libraries: OR-Tools (Google), OptaPlanner, etc.

---

### Idea: Shift Plan Distribution via Push Notifications & Email

  - Include location, time, special instructions
- **Understaffed Shift Alert:**
  - "Urgent: Can you cover a shift on 07.11?"
  - Voluntary pickup opportunity (with bonus pay?)

**3. Personalization & Preferences:**

- **Employee Preferences:**
  - Opt in/out of specific notification types
  - Choose preferred channels (email, push, SMS)
  - Set "Do Not Disturb" hours (no notifications at night)
- **Language Support:**
  - Multilingual templates (German, English, Turkish, Polish, etc.)
  - Automatic language detection based on employee profile

**4. Delivery Tracking:**

- **Audit Log:**
  - Track when notification was sent
  - Track when employee read notification (push: opened app, email: tracking pixel)
  - Proof of delivery for legal disputes
- **Failed Delivery Alerts:**
  - If email bounces or push token invalid
  - Manager gets alert to contact employee directly

**When to revisit:**

- After mobile app is launched (Phase 2)
- When organizations report communication issues
- When legal requirements demand proof of notification

**Complexity:** Medium (Infrastructure for Push/SMS)
**Priority:** Soon (Phase 2, after basic shift planning)

**Technical Notes:**

- Push: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)
- SMS: Twilio, AWS SNS, or local provider
- Email: Laravel Mail with queue for batch sending

---

### Idea: Mass Communication & Broadcast Messaging

  - "Please acknowledge that you have read this message"
  - Employees must click "I have read and understood"
  - Manager sees list of who acknowledged
- **Delivery Statistics:**
  - Sent: 150 employees
  - Delivered: 148 (2 bounced emails)
  - Read: 120 (80% open rate)
  - Acknowledged: 95 (if acknowledgment required)

**4. Scheduled Broadcasts:**

- **Schedule for Later:**
  - Compose message now, send tomorrow at 08:00
  - Useful for announcements during office hours
- **Recurring Messages:**
  - "Monthly safety reminder" (auto-send on 1st of each month)
  - "Weekly schedule preview" (auto-send every Friday)

**5. Templates & Quick Actions:**

- **Predefined Templates:**
  - "Office closure announcement"
  - "Weather alert"
  - "Policy update notification"
  - "Meeting invitation"
- **Quick Filters:**
  - "Last-minute shift coverage needed" ‚Üí Auto-targets available employees

**6. Compliance & Legal:**

- **Audit Trail:**
  - Who sent the message, when, to whom
  - Who read it, who acknowledged it
  - Legal proof for important communications (e.g., policy changes)
- **Unsubscribe Handling:**

  - But **cannot** opt out of critical/legal messages (policy updates, safety alerts)

**When to revisit:**

- After basic employee management is in place (Phase 1)
- When organizations request "mass email" feature
- When mobile app inbox is available

**Complexity:** Medium (Email queuing, targeting logic, read receipts)
**Priority:** Soon (Phase 2, high user demand)

**Technical Notes:**

- Laravel Notifications for multi-channel support
- Queue system for batch email sending (avoid rate limits)
- Database tables: `broadcasts`, `broadcast_recipients`, `broadcast_reads`
- Consider integration with external newsletter tools (Mailchimp, SendGrid) for advanced features

**Example Use Cases:**

1. **Weather Emergency:**
   - "Due to heavy snowfall, Object B is closed today. Scheduled employees will be reassigned."
   - Target: All employees scheduled for Object B today
   - Urgent flag: Yes
   - Channels: Email + Push + SMS

2. **Policy Update:**
   - "New GDPR training required for all employees. Deadline: 30.11.2025."
   - Target: All active employees
   - Acknowledgment required: Yes
   - Channels: Email + In-App Inbox
   - Attach: PDF of new policy

3. **Shift Coverage Request:**
   - "Urgent: Looking for volunteer to cover night shift on 05.11 at Object A."
   - Target: Employees with ¬ß34a, available on 05.11, prefer night shifts
   - Channels: Push notification + Email
   - Quick action: "I can cover this shift" button

**Technical Considerations:**

- Integrate with existing RBAC system
- Event sourcing for inventory changes? (audit trail)
- Barcode/QR code scanning for items and ID cards
- Mobile app support for field issuance
- Integration with laundry/cleaning services?
- Photo upload for condition documentation
- E-signature integration (DocuSign, Adobe Sign, or custom)
- Document versioning system
- Notification system (email, SMS, push notifications)

**Legal/Compliance:**

- Employee data privacy (size data is sensitive)
- Deposit regulations (Germany: Pfand-Regelungen)
- Tax implications of issued items (geldwerter Vorteil?)
- Liability for lost/damaged items
- ID card data protection (¬ß34a data is sensitive)
- Electronic signature validity (¬ß126b BGB - Textform)
- Document retention requirements (acknowledgments must be kept)
- GDPR compliance for acknowledgment tracking

**Related:**

- Employee Management (Core Feature)
- RBAC System (Core Feature)
- Multi-Branch Office Structure (if planned)
- Mobile Apps (ideas-backlog.md - for field issuance)
- Document Management System (for instructions/policies)
- BWR Integration (¬ß34a ID cards)

**Estimated Development Effort:**

**MVP (Basic Inventory + Issuance):**

- Backend: 6-8 weeks (data model, business logic, permissions)
- Frontend: 4-6 weeks (inventory UI, issuance flows, reports)
- Testing & Refinement: 2-3 weeks
- **Total:** ~3-4 months for basic MVP

**Full Feature Set (with ID Cards, Acknowledgments, Multi-Supplier):**

- Backend: 12-16 weeks (extended data model, workflow logic, e-signatures)
- Frontend: 8-10 weeks (extended UI, acknowledgment flows, ID card management)
- Mobile App (optional): 6-8 weeks (field issuance, signature capture)
- Integration: 4-6 weeks (suppliers, e-signature providers, document management)
- Testing & Refinement: 4-6 weeks
- **Total:** ~6-9 months for full feature set

**Phased Approach Recommended:**

1. **Phase 1 (3-4 months):** Basic clothing inventory + issuance
2. **Phase 2 (2-3 months):** ID card management + basic acknowledgments
3. **Phase 3 (2-3 months):** Advanced features (multi-supplier, cost centers, full acknowledgment system)
