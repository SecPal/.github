## 2025-10-28 - GitHub App Authentication Migration

**Project Board Automation migrated to GitHub App:**

- Replaced Fine-grained Personal Access Token with GitHub App authentication
- Created "SecPal" GitHub App (ID: 2196125) with organization-wide installation
- Updated all workflow callers to use `APP_ID` and `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets
- Implemented dynamic token generation using `actions/create-github-app-token@v1`
- Benefits: Auto-rotating tokens, bot identity ("SecPal[bot]"), improved reliability
- Resolved cross-repository API authentication issues
- Affected workflows: `.github/workflows/project-automation-core.yml`, caller workflows in all repos

## 2025-10-23 - Copilot Instructions Optimization

**copilot-instructions.md compressed and enhanced:**

- Compressed from 1,047 lines to 393 lines (62% reduction) for AI efficiency
- Removed Change History section (historical information irrelevant for AI)
- Restructured to terse, constraint-based format (AI-only optimization)
- Added AI Self-Check Protocol with trigger events and validation checklist
- Added Multi-Repo Coordination strategy (contracts â†’ api/frontend)
- Added Breaking Changes Process for actual software repositories
- Added CHANGELOG Maintenance guidelines
- Expanded Critical Rules from 6 to 10 (test coverage, commit signing, documentation, templates)
- Added Database Strategy (PostgreSQL prod, SQLite test, reversible migrations)
- Added API Guidelines (REST, JSON, URL versioning, JWT authentication)
- Enhanced Security section (SECURITY.md reference, response timelines)
- Made Copilot Review mandatory (was "recommended")
